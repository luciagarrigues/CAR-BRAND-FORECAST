Car Sales Analysis and Forecasting

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing car sales data to derive actionable insights, predict car prices, and forecast future trends. The dataset used is Car_data.csv, which includes information on car sales, customer details, prices, and dealer regions.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, fixed encoding issues, and formatted the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics, customer segmentation, sales analysis by region and model.
Predictive Modeling: Built a Random Forest model to predict car prices.
Time Series Forecasting: Forecasted future car prices using Exponential Smoothing.

Dataset

File: Car_data.csv
Columns:
Car_id: Unique ID for each car.
Date: Sale date.
Customer Name: Name of the customer.
Gender: Customer's gender.
Annual Income: Customer's annual income.
Dealer_Name: Name of the car dealer.
Company: Car manufacturer.
Model: Car model.
Engine: Type of engine.
Transmission: Type of transmission (auto/manual).
Color: Car color.
Price ($): Price of the car in dollars.
Dealer_No: Dealer number.
Body Style: Car body style (SUV, Passenger, Truck, etc.).
Phone: Customer's phone number.
Dealer_Region: Region of the dealer.




Key Analyses


1. Data Cleaning
Removed duplicate headers and handled encoding issues.
Converted columns like Price ($) and Annual Income to numeric.
Handled date formats and fixed special character encoding issues.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for prices.
Customer Segmentation: Segmented customers based on their annual income and analyzed car purchases within each income bracket.
Sales Analysis:
Sales by dealer region.
Most popular car models.
Most common body styles.

3. Predictive Modeling
Used Random Forest for predicting car prices based on features like Model, Annual Income, Dealer_Region, and Body Style.
Evaluated model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE).

4. Forecasting
Applied Exponential Smoothing to forecast future car prices based on historical sales data.
Forecasted car prices for the next 30 days.
Visualizations

Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into car sales trends, identified high-demand car models, and allowed for the prediction of car prices. The use of Random Forest and Exponential Smoothing helped in understanding both current and future market trends.

Next Steps
Implement additional models such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost for better price predictions.
Improve forecasting by incorporating more advanced time-series models like ARIMA.
Explore more features in the dataset for enhanced segmentation and predictions.
